	abstract = {This work focuses on document fragments association using deep metric learning methods. More precisely, we are interested in ancient papyri fragments that need to be reconstructed prior to their analysis by papyrologists. This is a challenging task to automatize using machine learning algorithms because labeled data is rare, often incomplete, imbalanced and of inconsistent conservation states. However, there is a real need for such software in the papyrology community as the process of reconstructing the papyri by hand is extremely time-consuming and tedious. In this paper, we explore ways in which papyrologists can obtain useful matching suggestion on new data using Deep Convolutional Siamese-Networks. We emphasize on low-to-no human intervention for annotating images. We show that the from-scratch self-supervised approach we propose is more effective than using knowledge transfer from a large dataset, the former achieving a top-1 accuracy score of 0.73 on a retrieval task involving 800 fragments.},

	abstract = {This review provides a comprehensive view of the field of historical document image binarization with a focus on the contributions made in the last decade. After the introduction of a standard benchmark dataset with the 2009 Document Image Binarization Contest, research in the field accelerated. Besides the standard methods for image thresholding, preprocessing, and post-processing, we review the literature on methods such as statistical models, pixel classification with learning algorithms, and parameter tuning. In addition to reviewing binarization algorithms, we discuss the available public datasets and evaluation metrics, including those that require pixel-level ground truth and those that do not. We conclude with recommendations for future work.},

	abstract = {Binarization of document images still attracts the researchers especially when degraded document images are considered. This is evident from the recent Document Image Binarization Competition ({DIBCO} 2019) where we can see researchers from all over the world participated in this competition. In this paper, we present a novel binarization technique which is found to be capable of handling almost all types of degradations without any parameter tuning. Present method is based on an ensemble of three classical clustering algorithms (Fuzzy C-means, K-medoids and K-means++) to group the pixels as foreground or background, after application of a coherent image normalization method. It has been tested on four publicly available datasets, used in {DIBCO} series, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. Present method gives promising results for the aforementioned datasets. In addition, this method is the winner of {DIBCO} 2019 competition.},
