\chapter{State of the Art}
\label{chap:stateArt}
In this chapter, we present an overview of the state-of-the art for this thesis. The common research field is computer vision and pattern recognition for cultural heritage. State-of-the-art presents the results of recent publications. Since numbers alone are not meaningful, the methods and exact contexts are also discussed. This includes approaches based on deep unsupervised metric learning, graph theory and data argumentation. Table \ref{tab:state-of-the-art} summarizes the key results and characteristics.

\section{Deep Metric Learning}
As indicated in the introduction, DML is a comparison-based algorithm and is therefore well suited for a field in which there is little ground truth. Pirone and his colleagues were the first who used DML in domain of papyri fragment retrieval. In their 2019 paper \dq Papy-S-Net : A Siamese Network to match papyrus fragments\dq, they presented a so-called Siamese network that was able to correctly match 79\% of the papyri fragments. In 2021, they further improved their approach. A dataset under a public domain was generated to better evaluate their results. Through certain experiments with different models and preprocessing steps, a top-1 accuracy of 0.73\% was achieved. Because the authors communicated clearly what data was used, how it was prepared, and what metrics were used, the results from 2021 are much more reliable.

\section{Graph Neural Networks}
even nice results it seems that it is supervised on artificial data was just. 

\section{Data Augmentation}
Until now there is no specific paper about that topic. But its suggested by prirone et al to do it.
